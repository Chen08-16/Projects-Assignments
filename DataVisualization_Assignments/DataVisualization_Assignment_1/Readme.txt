The following steps is used to open the group bar chart for the admissions by departments. 

1. Download the 0204957.zip file and extract it.
2. Download and install Visual Studio Code if it is not installed yet. 
3. Download an extension named "Live Server". 
4. Open the 0204957 folder in VS Code and look for the  A1_BarCharts.html.
5. Make sure the admission.csv and A1_BarCharts.html is in the same folder.
6. Press the "Go Live" button at the bottom right corner to run the program. 
7. Please use Microsoft Edge to act as the platform for the Liver Server function. (set Microsoft Edge as default if needed)
8. The group bar chart will be showing out when the Liver Server is running successfully. 

XAMPP is not used because there are error when using it on my laptop. Thus, VS Code is used instead of XAMPP.
The css and js code did not separate into a different file so there is only one html file for the bar chart. 
Please feel free to msg or discuss with me if there is any problem or question regarding the bar chart and report.
